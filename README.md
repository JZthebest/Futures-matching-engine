Futures Matching Engine (Java)

This is a backend order matching system for futures trading, written in Java using Spring Boot.  
It simulates the core logic of a centralized exchange: accepting orders, matching them based on price-time priority, and generating trade records.

This project is for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.
